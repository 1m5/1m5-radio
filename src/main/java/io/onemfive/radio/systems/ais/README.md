# Automatic Identification System (AIS)
AIS is an automatic tracking system that uses transponders on ships and is used by vessel traffic services (VTS). 
When satellites are used to detect AIS signatures, the term Satellite-AIS (S-AIS) is used. AIS information 
supplements marine radar, which continues to be the primary method of collision avoidance for water transport.
