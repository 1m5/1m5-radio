Software Defined Radio (SDR) as a sensor.

## Introduction
The radio component uses all radio bands within the electromagnetic spectrum to aid in censorship resistant communications.
It was conceived due to the realization that WiFi is easy to jam and thus the need for a more flexible range of radio options is necessary.
It requires GNU Radio to be installed locally and is in the very early stages of development.

## Installation
1. Install GNU Radio: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR
